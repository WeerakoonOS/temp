Create a file called, TimeSheet.txt and type the following data set. (The file contains the time durations 
in seconds that 5 runners recorded in their practice sessions.) 
Sumali 10 34 50 29 50 75 
Nimali 21 60 80 22 80 29 70 40 70 
Sunila 60 38 69 29 79 
Wimala 50 68 43 69 79 20 58 79 38 37 
Kamala 65 87 54 67 34 76 34 


1. Find the runners who did more than seven practice sessions and display with their names in the 
Python shell. 


 

2. Find the minimum time taken by each runner and display it along with her name in the Python 
shell. 


 

3. Find the average time of every runner and write it to another file called AverageTime.txt along 
with the runner’s name. 


 

4. Read the AverageTime.txt file and find the runner who has taken the minimum time in the 
practice sessions.
